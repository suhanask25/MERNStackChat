1. Technology Stack

The project is built using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — combined with Google Gemini API for AI-powered medical analysis.
This stack enables a fast, secure, and scalable platform for women to track their health conditions easily.

2. System Architecture
Frontend – React.js

Provides a responsive UI that works on all device sizes.

Allows users to upload PDF/Image medical reports.

Displays a symptom assessment test with simple questions.

Shows AI-generated risk score, insights, and daily tasks.

Backend – Node.js + Express

Handles file uploads from the frontend.

Sends the uploaded report to Gemini Vision API.

Processes AI output and extracts key medical parameters.

Combines report data and assessment answers to calculate a risk score.

Sends personalized recommendations and tasks back to the frontend.

AI Layer – Gemini API

Reads medical reports (PDF or image).

Extracts structured values such as thyroid levels, insulin, hormones, PCOS markers, etc.

Generates educational insights and daily routines (e.g., water intake, exercise, medication timing).

Provides supportive and easy-to-understand explanations.

Database – MongoDB

Stores user profiles and assessment history.

Saves extracted medical data for long-term tracking.

Stores recommended daily tasks and AI-generated insights.

3. Core Functionalities

Medical Report Upload

AI Risk Score Calculation
The backend processes all inputs and uses rules + AI analysis to generate a personalized risk score.

Daily Health Tasks Generation
Gemini creates tasks such as:
✓ water intake
✓ exercise plan
✓ medication reminder
✓ protein intake goal

Condition Tracking
Users can monitor PCOS, PCOD, and thyroid trends over time.
